# Frequently Asked Questions

## Services & Consultation

### What services do you offer?

We specialize in three main areas:
- **Ueki Services**: Traditional Japanese garden tree care, including selection, placement, pruning (Niwaki), and maintenance
- **Bonsai Services**: Custom Bonsai creation, styling, maintenance, and consultation
- **Landscape Design**: Complete Japanese garden design, installation, and project management

### Do you offer consultations?

Yes! We offer initial consultations to discuss your vision, assess your space, and provide recommendations. The consultation fee is applied toward any design or installation services you book.

### What areas do you serve?

We primarily serve the Portland metro area and surrounding regions including Eugene, Salem, and Vancouver. For larger projects, we may be able to travel further - please inquire.

### How much does a typical project cost?

Projects vary widely based on scope, size, and materials. A small consultation might be a few hundred dollars, while a complete garden redesign can range from $10,000 to $50,000+. We're happy to provide estimates during the consultation phase.

## Design & Installation

### How long does a typical project take?

Timeline depends on the project scope:
- Small pruning projects: 1 day
- Courtyard gardens: 2-4 weeks
- Full landscape redesigns: 6-12 weeks
- Ongoing maintenance: Seasonal visits throughout the year

### Can you work with my existing landscape?

Absolutely! Many of our projects involve enhancing or transforming existing landscapes. We can work with mature trees, existing hardscaping, and integrate new elements harmoniously.

### Do you source all materials?

Yes, we handle all plant procurement, materials sourcing, and delivery. We have relationships with specialty nurseries for authentic Japanese plants and materials.

### Will the plants survive our climate?

Yes! We carefully select species that thrive in the Pacific Northwest climate while maintaining authentic Japanese garden aesthetics. We choose plants hardy to our zone and suited to your specific site conditions.

## Maintenance & Care

### Do you offer ongoing maintenance?

Yes, we offer seasonal maintenance plans that include pruning, fertilizing, pest management, and general care. This ensures your garden remains healthy and beautiful year-round.

### How often do Japanese garden trees need pruning?

Most Ueki (Japanese garden trees) benefit from pruning once or twice per year:
- **Pines**: Late autumn after growth hardens
- **Maples**: Winter dormancy and summer touch-ups
- **Flowering trees**: After blooming

### Can you train me to maintain my own garden?

Yes! We offer maintenance training sessions where we teach you the basics of Japanese garden care, including proper pruning techniques, seasonal tasks, and species-specific care.

### What if something dies or doesn't thrive?

We stand behind our work. If a plant fails to thrive due to installation issues within the first year, we'll work with you to address the problem. All plants come with a one-year warranty (excluding damage from neglect, weather extremes, or pests).

## Bonsai Specific

### Do you sell Bonsai trees?

We occasionally have Bonsai available for sale, and we can source specific species upon request. We also create custom Bonsai from nursery stock or collected material.

### How often does Bonsai need maintenance?

Active maintenance (watering, feeding) is daily to weekly depending on season and species. Structural work (pruning, wiring, repotting) is seasonal - typically 2-4 times per year. We offer maintenance services if you prefer professional care.

### Can you work on my existing Bonsai?

Yes! We offer styling, repotting, pest management, and general health consultations for existing Bonsai collections.

### What species do you recommend for beginners?

For the Pacific Northwest, we recommend:
- Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum)
- Trident Maple (Acer buergerianum)
- Japanese Black Pine (Pinus thunbergii)
- Juniper (Juniperus species)

These are forgiving, readily available, and beautiful in our climate.

### Do you have a portfolio I can review?

Yes! Please visit our Portfolio page to see completed projects. We're also happy to provide references from past clients.

### What's the next step after consultation?

If we're a good fit, we'll create a detailed proposal including design concepts, plant selections, timeline, and pricing. Once approved, we'll schedule the work and begin transforming your space.
