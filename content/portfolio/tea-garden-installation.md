## Project Overview

Create an authentic tea garden (roji) for a tea ceremony practitioner, incorporating traditional elements and following classical design principles.

## Client Goals

- Authentic tea garden design
- Functional path from entrance to tea house
- Seasonal plantings reflecting Japanese aesthetics
- Historical accuracy in element placement

## Our Approach

We studied historical tea gardens and adapted traditional design principles to the Pacific Northwest setting. Every element was chosen for its symbolic meaning and contribution to the contemplative journey.

## Key Features

- **Roji Path**: Stepping stone path with intentional pauses and turns
- **Waiting Bench**: Traditional machiai for guests
- **Water Basin**: Hand-carved granite tsukubai
- **Plantings**: Native species with Japanese aesthetic (ferns, hostas, Japanese forest grass)
- **Symbolic Gates**: Two passages marking the transition from worldly to spiritual space

## Timeline

6 weeks for complete installation

## Results

The client now hosts monthly tea ceremonies in an authentic setting. The garden has been featured in regional tea ceremony publications and serves as a teaching tool for students.
