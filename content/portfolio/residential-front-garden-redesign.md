## Project Overview

Redesign a suburban front garden to enhance curb appeal while creating a peaceful, Japanese-inspired entrance that complements the home's contemporary architecture.

## Client Goals

- Increase curb appeal
- Year-round visual interest
- Balance modern and traditional aesthetics
- Manageable maintenance

## Our Approach

We layered plantings to create depth and seasonal interest, anchored by a stunning specimen Japanese maple (Acer palmatum 'Bloodgood'). Strategic pruning of existing trees opened sight lines while maintaining privacy.

## Key Features

- **Specimen Japanese Maple**: Fall focal point with brilliant red foliage
- **Evergreen Structure**: Shaped pines and azaleas provide year-round greenery
- **Natural Stone Path**: Irregular stepping stones through moss and ground cover
- **Lighting**: Subtle uplighting highlights the maple at night
- **Water Feature**: Small tsukubai-inspired basin near entrance

## Timeline

3 weeks for installation, ongoing seasonal maintenance

## Results

The transformation dramatically improved the home's curb appeal. The maple's autumn display has become a neighborhood landmark, and the clients report increased tranquility from their front rooms.
