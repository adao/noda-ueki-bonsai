## Project Overview

Transform a neglected urban courtyard into a serene Zen-inspired retreat featuring traditional Ueki (Japanese garden trees), carefully raked gravel, and natural stone elements.

## Client Goals

- Create a meditation space
- Low-maintenance design
- Authentic Japanese aesthetic
- Privacy from neighboring buildings

## Our Approach

We selected drought-tolerant species suited to the Pacific Northwest climate while maintaining authentic Japanese garden aesthetics. The focal point is a mature Japanese black pine (Kuromatsu) trained in the Niwaki style.

## Key Features

- **Shaped Pines**: Two Japanese black pines pruned to reveal natural branch structure
- **Dry Garden**: Raked gravel representing water, bordered by weathered stones
- **Bamboo Fence**: Custom-built bamboo screening for privacy
- **Stone Lantern**: Traditional Oribe-style lantern as focal point
- **Ground Cover**: Moss and low-growing Mondo grass

## Timeline

4 weeks from design approval to completion

## Results

The courtyard has become the client's favorite space for morning meditation and evening relaxation. The low-maintenance design requires only seasonal pruning and occasional raking.
