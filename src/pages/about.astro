          <h1>About Noda Ueki and Bonsai</h1>
          
          <p>Noda Ueki and Bonsai was founded on a deep respect for the centuries-old traditions of Japanese horticulture. Having trained under master gardeners in Japan, we bring authentic expertise to every project while thoughtfully adapting traditional techniques to work harmoniously with the South Bay LA climate and modern lifestyles.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Our Approach:</strong> We begin every project by truly understanding your vision and your space. We employ traditional Japanese methods - from site assessment principles to pruning techniques - that have been refined over centuries. Every location is unique, and we work with your specific conditions to create a design that feels natural and inevitable. Japanese gardens reveal different beauties through the seasons, so we design with the full annual cycle in mind.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Design Philosophy:</strong> Our work is guided by timeless Japanese aesthetic principles. We embrace asymmetry and natural balance rather than rigid symmetry. Restraint and clarity ensure every element has purpose. Our designs and pruning work with the natural growth patterns of plants. Gardens should reveal themselves slowly, inviting exploration. While we honor classical forms, each garden is unique to its place and people.</p>
