          <h2>Services & Consultation</h2>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What services do you offer?</h3>
            <p>We specialize in Ueki (traditional Japanese garden tree care), Bonsai services (creation, styling, and maintenance), complete garden design, and ongoing maintenance programs.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do you offer consultations?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Initial consultations discuss your vision, assess your space, and provide recommendations. The consultation fee is applied toward any design or installation services you book.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What areas do you serve?</h3>
            <p>We service the South Bay LA area.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How much does a typical project cost?</h3>
            <p>Projects vary widely based on scope, size, and materials. We provide detailed estimates during the consultation phase.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Design & Installation -->
        <div class="faq-section">
          <h2>Design & Installation</h2>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How long does a typical project take?</h3>
            <p>Timeline depends on project scope. Small pruning projects take 1 day, courtyard gardens 2-4 weeks, and full landscape redesigns 6-12 weeks.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can you work with my existing landscape?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely. Many of our projects involve enhancing or transforming existing landscapes. We can work with mature trees, existing hardscaping, and integrate new elements harmoniously.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Will the plants survive our climate?</h3>
            <p>Yes. We carefully select species that thrive in the South Bay LA climate while maintaining authentic Japanese garden aesthetics.</p>

        <!-- Maintenance & Care -->
        <div class="faq-section">
          <h2>Maintenance & Care</h2>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do you offer ongoing maintenance?</h3>
            <p>Yes. We offer maintenance plans that include pruning, fertilizing, pest management, and general care to ensure your garden remains healthy and beautiful year-round.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How often do Japanese garden trees need pruning?</h3>
            <p>Most Ueki benefit from pruning once or twice per year. Pines are pruned in late autumn, maples during winter dormancy, and flowering trees after blooming.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can you train me to maintain my own garden?</h3>
            <p>Yes. We offer training sessions where we teach the basics of Japanese garden care, including proper pruning techniques and seasonal tasks.</p>

            <h3>Do you sell Bonsai trees?</h3>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can you work on my existing Bonsai?</h3>
